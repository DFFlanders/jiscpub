## Open Access Monograph Technical Themes ##
Overarching technical concerns:
  * Author wordprocessing environments and ease of visualising monograph in various h/w device types/formats (tablet, mobile, reader, eink (b&w / color), etc).
  * Stylesheets that publishers can provide to wordprocessing environment that prep the manuscript for submission to editorial workflow (e.g. NLM DTD)
  * APIs for submitting monograph manuscript from authoring environment (wordprecessor, blog, etc) into publisher and/or aggregator systems.
  * Canonical format for working with monograph manuscript as it progresses through editorial workflow, i.e. ePub (CSS3, Javascript, HTML), HTML5, XML, etc.
  * Ability to ascribe meta-editorial workflow information to manuscript as it progresses through multiple edits?
  * Ability by publisher (and independent author) to publish completed manuscript (via APIs?) to eBook aggregator (Kindle, iTunes, Guttenberg, etc).
  * Ability by independent author to optimise SEO of final manuscript for discovery (by publiishers, by readers, etc).
